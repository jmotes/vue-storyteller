# Storyblok Vue.js/Bootstrap 4 Starter Template
> An experiment by Team SI's developers.

This project is a work in progress, created for evaluating the feasibility of using a decoupled, headless / API-first architecture at Team SI. The goal is for the content store to define all layouts, hence making headless a real possibility for marketing websites where quick content and layout changes are often needed.

Vue.js makes this possible by binding the data source to dynamic components such as grid elements, carousels, call-to-actions and other reusable "blocks".

## Features Implemented

- Hosted on a CDN - no server-side logic required.
- Pre-rendering - search engines pick up content generated by Javascript. Currently implemented by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/prerendering/)
- Dynamic navigation, allowing the data store to implement a custom navbar - or even a mega menu.
- Several reusable content blocks - grid row and columns, hero component, call-to-actions, markdown, and images.
- Reusable page templates.
- Automatic lazy loading and in-place image optimization on image components via StoryBlok's [Image Service](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/image-service) (just specify the width and/or height on each component instance)
