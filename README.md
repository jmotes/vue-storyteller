# Storyblok Vue.js/Bootstrap 4 Starter Template
> An experiment by Team SI's developers.

This project is a work in progress, created for evaluating the feasibility of using a decoupled, headless / API-first architecture at Team SI. The goal is for the content store to define all layouts, hence making headless a real possibility for marketing websites where quick content and layout changes are often needed.

Vue.js makes this possible by binding the data source to dynamic components such as grid elements, carousels, call-to-actions and other reusable "blocks".

[Demo Site](https://teamsi-vuejs-starter.netlify.com/)

## Concepts
- Simply create your schemas and data in the CMS, then code reusable Vue.js components in this project with props to match the schema.
- To use components this project already includes, just create your content schemas to match the props.
- `dist` folder can be deployed directly to a CDN - no need for a full web server.
- Site can be pre-rendered with [Netlify's pre-rendering service](https://www.netlify.com/docs/prerendering/) to allow search engines to pick up content generated by Javascript (we plan to look into [server-side rendering](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/ssr.html) later).

## Features (so far)
- Dynamic navigation support, allowing the data store to define a custom navbar - or even a mega menu.
- Several reusable content blocks - grid row and columns, hero component, call-to-actions, markdown, and images.
- Reusable page templates.
- Automatic lazy loading and in-place image optimization on image components via StoryBlok's [Image Service](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/image-service) (just specify the width and/or height on each component instance).
